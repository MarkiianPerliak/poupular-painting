        <li>It’s not a square – and it’s not black</li>
        <li>It has two dates of creation</li>
        <li>It’s actually a part of a triptych. When the ‘Black Supremacist Square’ was first exhibited in 1915, it was shown along with two other “main supremacist forms” – ‘Black Circle’ and ‘Black Cross’, which are less known than the ‘Black square’.</li>
        <li>It’s painted over another painting</li>
        <li>It’s not the first total black painting</li>
        <li>Malevich also painted ‘Red Square’ and ‘White Square’</li>
