    <p class="MonaLi">Gustav Klimt depicts the couple locked in an intimate embrace against a gold, flat background. The two figures are
         situated at the edge of a patch of flowery meadow that ends under the woman's exposed feet. The man wears a robe printed with
          geometric patterns and subtle swirls. He wears a crown of vines while the woman wears a crown of flowers. She is shown in a
           flowing dress with floral patterns. The man's face is not shown to the audience and instead, his face is bent downward to
            press a kiss to the woman's cheek, and his hands are cradling the woman's face. Her eyes are closed, with one arm wrapped
             around the man's neck, the other resting gently on his hand, and her face is upturned to receive the man's kiss. </p>
